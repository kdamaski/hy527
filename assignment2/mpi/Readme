General setup
=======================

First time setup your ssh public keys, to login to the nodes without password.
  ssh-keygen -t dsa
  into .ssh directory make: cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys2
Also it is recommended to login once to each node that you will use with mpi.

Copy all files from /home1/cs527/mpi to your account.
Login to one of the mpi nodes.
Inspect the files. 
Compile the application (with mpicc compiler)

Configure MPI for your account:
-Create on your home directory a file with name .mpd.conf which contains:
secretword=XXXXX, when XXXXX a secret key of your choice.

-Start mpd deamons at the cluster nodes, executing the following command:
mpdboot -n 8 -f mpd.hosts
After this command, mpdtrace should print all the 8 nodes piranha73-piranha80.
When you finish running your mpi programs, you can kill the created mpi deamons
using the command: mpdallexit.

To run an mpi application:
 To compile an application you should use the mpicc compiler.
 To run it, use the command: mpirun -np N APPL,
     where: N the number of processors,
            and APPL the compiled program, described from it's full path.
